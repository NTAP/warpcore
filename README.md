## About

Warpcore is a minimal userspace UDP/IP/Ethernet stack for the [netmap packet
I/O framework](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/). Due to its dependency
on netmap, warpcore supports Linux (with a netmap-patched kernel) and FreeBSD
(which has netmap support since release 11).

Warpcore also has a backend implementation using the Socket API that should
compile on generic POSIX platforms, such as Linux, Darwin and others. The POSIX
backend has experimental support for the
[Particle](https://github.com/particle-iot/device-os) IoT stack, allowing
applications built on warpcore (such as [quant](https://github.com/NTAP/quant))
to support embedded devices. Warpcore also has an experimental support for
[RIOT](http://riot-os.org/), another IoT stack.

Warpcore prioritizes performance over features, and over full standards
compliance. It supports zero-copy transmit and receive with netmap, and uses
neither threads, timers nor signals. It exposes the underlying file descriptors
to an application, for easy integration with different event loops (e.g.,
[libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html)).

The warpcore repository is [on GitHub](https://github.com/NTAP/warpcore).

## Building

Warpcore uses [cmake](https://cmake.org/) as a build system. To do an
out-of-source build of warpcore (best practice with `cmake`), do the following
to build with `make` as a generator:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir Debug
    cd Debug
    cmake ..
    make

(cmake supports other generators, such as [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
(which I highly recommend over `make`). See the [cmake
documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).)

On platforms where netmap is available, the steps above will build a debug
version of `libsockcore.a` against netmap as a backend, and place it into the
`Debug/lib`. Examples (`sockping` and `sockinetd`) will be built in `Debug/bin`.

On platforms where netmap is available, the steps above will also build a debug
version of `libwarpcore.a` against netmap as a backend, and place it into the
`Debug/lib`. Examples (`warpping` and `warpinetd`) will also be built in
`Debug/bin`.

The example server application implements the
[`echo`](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc862.txt),
[`discard`](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc863.txt),
[`time`](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc868.txt) and
[`daytime`](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc867.txt) services.

The default build (per above) is without optimizations and with extensive debug
logging enabled. In order to build an optimized build, do this:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mkdir Release
    cd Release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

## Documentation

Warpcore comes with documentation. This documentation can be built (if `doxygen`
is installed) by doing

    make doc

in any build directory. The starting page of the documentation is then
`doc/html/index.html`.
